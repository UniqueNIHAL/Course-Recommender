- Gen AI Course Recommender Bot.
- PCL Team 4 Project

- **Overview**
Students often fail to choose the right educational resource like course, internship, events, projects, including Project Saadhna and Code Vipassna. Students sometimes are influenced by friends, spam emails, advertisements that aren’t the best in the market, sometimes students even end up paying thousands of rupees for internships!

The AI — Chat bot is trained on a custom data-set prepared by my team, to recommend actually industry standard, useful educational resources, courses, events.

We consider high quality industry standard courses like Google Cyber Security Professional, The Odin Project for web development, cs50x by Harvard for Computer Science basics.

- **AIM**
To guide students to events like code vipassana, workshop meetups held by clubs like Azure developer club, expert good quality courses like cs50x, Google Cyber Security Professional Certificate, etc.
To stop students from choosing internships where they pay themselves, choose training programmes that use recorded videos charging like 30k per student.

**Design**
The AI Chat — Bot is hosted on the Google cloud platform, built using Vertex AI Agent Builder. The chat bot runs on a custom data set, stored on a google cloud bucket.
